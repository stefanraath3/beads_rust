# AGENTS.md (Agent-First Entry Point)

This folder is a thin, agent-first map into the existing `br` documentation set.

In this fork, use `bx` for all issue-tracker commands. The fork standardizes on `rusqlite` after `fsqlite` / `frankensqlite` produced real storage failures, including `cursor must be on a leaf to delete`.

If you are an AI coding agent working in this repo, start here:

- Safety + workflow rules: `AGENTS.md` (repo root)
- First 30 seconds: `docs/agent/QUICKSTART.md`
- Machine output (JSON/TOON): `docs/agent/ROBOT_MODE.md`
- Schemas + key folding notes: `docs/agent/SCHEMA.md`
- Error shapes + exit codes: `docs/agent/ERRORS.md`
- Example flows: `docs/agent/EXAMPLES.md`

Reference docs (deeper, more verbose):

- CLI flags/commands: `docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md`
- Agent integration guide: `docs/AGENT_INTEGRATION.md`
